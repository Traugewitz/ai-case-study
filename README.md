# A Case Study on Gro Intelligence
### A Data Analytics Company Using Artificial Intelligence that Combines Socio- Economics with Agricultural Ecology to Predict Trends

## Overview and Origin

* *What is the name of company, When was the company incorporated? Who are the founders of the company?*
  
I researched Gro Intelligence (Gro). Sara Menker (founder and CEO) and Sewit Ahderom (Cofounder and COO) incorporated this company in 2014.

* *How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*

Sara was attracted to commodities trading "because it was attached to things that are physical and necessary to life,” she said.[^1] In this article, Sara talked about how her childhood "imprinted a profound sense of how easily life can be disrupted by catastrophic forces, and the importance of preparing for looming disaster." 


* *How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*
  
Gro is privately funded. Current funding is estimated at $88.5M, with an employee count between 51-200 employees. As of January 2021, Gro has undergone three rounds of funding and currently in Series B funding. Offices are located in Nairobi, Ethiopia and New York City, NY, USA.[^2] 
## Business Activities

* *What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?*

According to Gro's website, Gro focuses on illuminating the interrelationships between the Earth's ecology and the global economy, with the goal of developing a holistic understanding of how end-to-end business is impacted - and then providing information so that businesses can act on these insights.[^3] 

* *Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*

Gro's intended customer has a broad appeal to a variety of customers, working with thousands of clients, ranging from big food companies like Unilever and Yum! Brands to financial institutions, including BNP Paribas and Wells Fargo. **Gro provides them them with a host of data and analysis on the global agricultural ecosystem.**[^4] The financial market size is easily a multibillion dollar industry, considering the customers Gro caters to.  For example, Unilever is a behomoth company in the ready-to-eat market as well as agriculture. As a former Sr. Data Analyst with a company that leads in agricultural mining, manufacturing, wholesale and retail, I can confidently say that when they find out about Gro Intelligence, they will likely eagerly subscribe for access to this data.  This concept provides a crystal ball, even if a bit cloudy, to so many interconnected industries and investors of those industries.

* *What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*

Simply put, Gro compiles data sets, analyzes the data, and then provides predictive analytics on the interrelationships between the Earth's ecology and the global economy. Specifically, Gro ingests and analyzes over 650 trillion data points from more than 40,000 sources—crop forecasts, satellite images, topography, reports on precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration—to provide insights and forecasts into 15,000 unique agricultural products.[^5] 

For example, Gro has created models on how the African swine fever impacted the Chinese pork market and its subsequent cascading impact on global commodity prices, or how a threatened trucker strike over the cost of diesel fuel could possibly impact sugar prices in Brazil.  On a purely business impact and because it has the climate data, Gro created a climate-risk score to assess the future of 300 ski destinations.

Back to the mission of the company, though, the company also works with governments around the world on food-security issues, to help them adequately plan for reserves.[^6] 

* *Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)*
* 
Gro uses publically available datasets, the scale and quality of the data (satellite or ground-based, environmental or socio-economic, supply-side or demand-side) make it ideal for machine learning.[^7]  Gro states that satellite-remote sensing provides most of our geospatial data sources at Gro, but also offers direct observations from sources like NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) weather stations, which measure precipitation and temperature. The use of satellite imaging, drones, GIS that can monitor, measure and store training data on various metrics in real time, the use of robotics to solve labor shortages

## Landscape

* *What field is the company in?*
  
Gro is primarily in the field of Agriculture with an emphasis on socio-economic consequences impacting agriculture's ecological journies, whether these be man-made or naturally occuring events.  The AI field is machine learning for time series forecasting, deep learning because it is analyzing data from various sources, such as satellite imagery, weather sensors, and soil sensors. They provide valuable insights for crop management, disease detection, irrigation scheduling, and yield prediction, leading to more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices.

* *What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 - 10 years?*
* 
Agriculture, as a natural science, has historically been a data rich environment.  However, only in the last few decades has there been any serious attempt to capture this metadata which is spread out amongst many segregated platforms. The United States, through agencies such as the USDA, NRCS, and ARS collect data, cleans it, then releases it in a datasheet. **If** analysis is done, it is primarily through staff economists.  Additionally, globally, the World Food Bank, and the Food and Agricultural Organizaton (FAO), have come together with individual countries to attempt to harmonize data so that they can help predict food (grains) supply and trade.
In the last 5-10 years, there has been little movement in the agricultural sector to merge these available data sets. Though Agriculture uses AI to monitor crops on individual grower fields, drive tractors, e.g, conglomerating, harvesting, analyzying this data into one central area is rare.  On a side note, I find it interesting that Gro Intelligence was founded 1 year after Monsanto bought Climate Corp, a similar company focused only on weather patterns for roughly $1.1B

In terms of AI and robotics, Australia is using AI to help predict harsh weather and  real time data about their crops, Peru is using robotics to help harvest certain fruits.  I believe this will be an emerging field due to the combined issues of the labor intensive harvesting practices and labor shortages.^y google 

* *What are the other major companies in this field?*
  
Other companies that occupy this space include Atmospheric G2, AgriCensus, AgFlow, Cliimate Corp: a Monsanto-aqcuired start-up.

## Results

* *What has been the business impact of this company so far?*

As previously mentioned, in 2013, Monsanto acquired a relatively small company called Climate Corp for $1.1B. Weather is one of the biggest factors affectomg agriculture outcomes.  Historically, In agriculture, data is held "close to the chest" of growers and their crop advising companies.  One of the few real time, publicly available data sets is weather.  By having access to this centrally located data, Monsanto purchased a company with proven ML capacities centered around climate.

In the same vane, Gro is disrupting the landscape by replicating this idea, though broadening the scope of the data collected.  By doing so, Gro can use current inputs into developed models created by the massive amount of collected data and give subscribers and clients crucial market indicators.

* *What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?*
  
There are a few minor companies in the agricultural-data conglomeration space but none that have done the scale of data collecting, analzying, and predicting as Gro Intelligence.  Gro is definitely the front runner in this field.  As a privately funded company, revenues are not publically stated, however, given that Gro Intelligence was selected as a technology pioneer by World Economic Forum in 2021 as well as Time Magazine naming Gro on their Top 100 Most Influential Companies, and then using Climate Corp's acquisition into Monsanto for over $1B, I believe all of these are strong indicators that Gro Intelligence will be incredibly successful financially.

## Recommendations

* *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*

*   I chose this company because I have worked in this field utelizing outdated data (collection through our government and world organizaitons such as the fao takes years). By the time I was able to work with this data, it was already dated.  Additionally, agriculture is not a static industry.  So many variables are in play every day. By utelizing ML, AI, and predictive analytics, Gro combined these variables into one place and is leading the way of creating a real world data set-ecology. 
I would advise the company to also look at soil conditions on a world scale.  There is a lot of emphasis on weather and fertilizer.  However, one of the largest contributions to crop yield is the health of the soil.  Soil inputs are an emerging field as we are now realizing that one teaspoon of soil is home to billions of microbes.  These microbes are different from one plot of land to another, yet these microbes are a large part of soil quality.

* *Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*
  
By including soil metrics, Gro can better advise clients on the large and small scale trends on soil tilth in certain regions.  Specifically, I am thinking emerging markets and third world countries that have damaged soil due to poor agricultural techniques and weather combined.

* *What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*
  
With my limited knowledge, I do not have any recommendations to give this company at this time other than what is currently being utelized. I am excited to see that a company has stepped into this space and created a starting point in which decisions made from a regional point of view can be analyzed for global impact.
